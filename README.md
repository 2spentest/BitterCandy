# BitterCandy - Shellcode Loader POC

## Overview
BitterCandy is a Proof of Concept (POC) shellcode loader designed for educational purposes and research into static detection mechanisms. This project serves as a learning tool to understand how shellcode loaders work and how they can be detected by security solutions.

## Purpose
This project is intended for:
- Educational purposes in malware analysis and detection
- Research into static detection mechanisms
- Understanding shellcode execution techniques
- Learning about Windows API usage for process manipulation

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer
This project is provided for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. The techniques demonstrated in this code should only be used in controlled environments for learning and research. Using this code for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited and may be illegal.

## Features
- Shellcode loading and execution
- Process manipulation capabilities
- Demonstrates various Windows API techniques
- Educational examples of common shellcode execution patterns

## Anti-Detection Techniques (For Educational Purposes)
This project demonstrates several techniques used to understand how security solutions detect malicious code:

1. **AMSI Bypass**
   - Demonstrates how AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) works
   - Shows the importance of proper security implementation

2. **Shellcode Encryption**
   - AES encryption implementation for shellcode
   - Understanding how encryption affects static detection
   - Learning about key and IV management

3. **Process Manipulation**
   - Techniques for process creation and manipulation
   - Understanding Windows API usage patterns
   - Learning about process injection methods

4. **Static Detection Evasion**
   - String obfuscation techniques
   - API call obfuscation
   - Understanding signature-based detection

These techniques are included solely for educational purposes to help security researchers and developers understand how to better protect their systems.

## Usage
This project is intended to be used in a controlled environment for learning purposes. Before running any code:
1. Ensure you have a proper development environment set up
2. Use only in isolated testing environments
3. Do not use against any systems without explicit permission
